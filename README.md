# Ear Training Gadget

The goal of this project is to create a simple NodeJS application to help with ear training.

My goal is to have this application running on a Raspberry Pi Zero W and use a Pimoroni player to drive it.

## Audio

To output audio we are using a Midi audio player called Audacious.

The ear-training application will start and stop Audacious automatically.

When we need to play sounds we will use Audacious to load the file and play it.

### Midi set-up

-   Install Audacious

*   Install a Midi Soundfont
